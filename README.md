# About The Movie Tracker

## Overview

Welcome to **The Movie Tracker**, a self-development project dedicated to building a fully responsive dynamic website using Next.js. This project revolves around creating an extensive catalog of movies, TV shows, and related individuals, providing users with detailed information. It goes beyond by allowing users to log in, mark movies as watched, rate them, and curate their viewing history—a personalized experience akin to Goodreads for books.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Catalog:** The Movie Tracker employs Next.js for server-side rendering, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience while exploring movie and TV show details.

- **User Interaction:** Users can log in, mark movies as watched, rate them, and conveniently track their viewing history, enhancing user engagement and personalization.

- **Testing and Documentation:** Comprehensive unit testing with Jest ensures code reliability. Storybook is utilized for component cataloging, UI testing, and documentation, promoting clarity and efficiency in development.

- **Styling and Architecture:** Built on [Atölye 15](https://github.com/atolye15)'s SCSS starter, The Movie Tracker adheres to the BEM methodology and ITCSS with Sass, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase. Dependency inversion is implemented to reduce coupling to external APIs.

- **Hosting and Continuous Integration:** The Movie Tracker is hosted on Netlify, featuring a robust CI pipeline that facilitates regular updates and improvements to the project.

## Goals and Future Plans

### General Goals

- Adhere to best web practices, including accessibility and performance optimization.
- Achieve high test coverage through Jest, ensuring the reliability of the codebase.
- Catalog each component in Storybook for comprehensive documentation and testing.

### Future Plans

- Authentication implementation using technologies like Supertokens or Firebase Auth.
- Database integration for advanced movie tracking (database type to be determined).
- Introduction of editorial content pages, featuring posts, interviews, and other engaging content.

## Project Status

**The Movie Tracker** is a work in progress, regularly updated, and envisioned as a long-term project. Stay tuned for new features, enhancements, and the realization of planned functionalities.
